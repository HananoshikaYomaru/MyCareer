## We are the right company for you, if you

- want to work on a product that matters to a lot of people – we handle hundreds of visits per second and host50M+ documents,
- consider yourself one of the best at what you do and you're looking for equally talented colleagues,
- are self-driven and would never just want to take the next ticket,
- are curious and never stopped learning and exploring new languages, technologies and solutions,
- seek a culture where all voices matter when it comes to shaping the future of the product,
- want to work with colleagues who have a ‘here to help’ attitude, and absolutely want to help you succeed,
- be part of an international team that continuously challenges the status quo.

## What you will be doing

- delivering results that create value for the end-users, while we ensure a high-performance, high-availability, robust product that scale with our traffic (10.000++ requests/second) and data-heavy platforms (100++ terabytes),
- contributing to our Conversion pipeline that is responsible for processing all asset types on our platform and producing the artifacts used within Issuu that are later on combined in different ways and presented as new types of content formats (cool, right?),
- working across disciplines, and take a holistic, end-2-end approach to software development,
- solving problems from just about every area of computer science, including search, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language, processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, big data and so on.

## What you bring with you

- a Master’s degree in CS or equivalent,
- strong competencies in data structures, algorithms and software design,
- experience designing and building robust, high-volume production systems,
- experience with scalable microservice architecture,
- experience with Python (or other dynamically typed systems),
- extensive knowledge of Unix/Linux,
- experience with relational databases (MySQL, Postgres, …),
- experience with C++ is nice to have,
- excellent communications skills in English.

## Other things you should know are

we're currently working on Issuu’s Story Cloud both on web and mobile apps, machine learning for better understanding of our content, internal analytics and our famous reading experience to mention a few examples,

- we currently use Python, OCaml, Typescript, Javascript (client and server side), Erlang/elixir, Kotlin, and a bit of C++, and we’re open to using new languages and/or technologies,
- our architecture is microservice-oriented using AMQP,
- we deploy multiple times a day on AWS and use Docker Swarm and
- Kubernetes, MySQL, Redis, Node, etc.,
- we strive to be agile (who doesn’t?), but we're not religious about Scrum, Kanban or any other methodology,
- we have many cross-team guilds where we share knowledge, coordinate efforts, and help each other the best we can,
- “20% time”: everyone gets one day a week to invest as they see fit (i.e. learn something new, experiment with new ideas in the product, join efforts with others, improve what you think matters, ...).

## The impact you will have on our customers

- creating new things they could not have done before,
  sharing those creations with more people than they could have reached before,
- reaching new levels of success than they could have imagined before.

## What you'll get

- a competitive compensation package,
- meaningful equity in a profitable growth-stage company,
- health and dental insurance,
- a flat structure – every opinion matters regardless of team or position.
